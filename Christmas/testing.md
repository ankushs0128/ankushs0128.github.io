## Bugs discovered ##

The issue log is managed on the [GitHub Project Issues section](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/issues) using the standard GitHub [bug\_report.md template](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)


#### Known Bugs ####

[Issue #60](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/issues/60)
- Unit Testing: Homepage callout image doesnâ€™t resize on an iPad or iPhone display
  - CSS property `background-attachment: fixed;` is not recognised by Apple devices and causes the website hero images using this property to display incorrectly
  - The workaround is to set the property back to the default `background-attachment: scroll;` but this will affect all devices and remove the image effect I was aiming for.
    - Smaller versions of the background images were uploaded with a width of 960px to cover tablet and mobile devices
    - Media query with a `max-width: 1366px;` was added to the [style.css](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/blob/master/assets/css/style.css) file and included the container classes for each of the page background images with the background attributes set to `background: url('../images/image-file.pg') no-repeat center scroll; background-size: cover;`
    - This works correctly on all device types now but is not a completely satisfactory solution; in keeping with what I had designed.
    - I think the design has reached the limits of my experience for the time available but adding JavaScript at a later time may add the functionality to allow the original design on all device types.
